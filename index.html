My name is Zhihao Guo, I am cheerful, talkative, often with a smile, like to smile to others, like to share their own happiness with all people.
I have a wide range of hobbies, such as travelling, listening to music, playing chess and various kinds of sports.
I am a practical, hard-working and self-motivated student.
As soon as I entered the university, I set strict demands on myself, determined to make achievements in my university life and develop myself in all aspects.
I'm a perfectionist, I knew there is no perfect person, but we can go to pursue, to keep close to it, every one more or less has faults, I compare these drawbacks to an invisible hole, we all know that hole can be filled, like faults can be corrected, this also will be how we put the hole fill in bit by bit, is how to perfect his bit by bit.
The hole is invisible, just like the person will not be perfect, we may never fill the hole, just like the person will not be perfect, just like learning, learning is endless.
So I have to keep filling holes, keep learning, keep improving myself.
So, I chose what I pursue, pursue what I choose -- to enter the student union.
I took an active part in other conference activities and got some exercise. Under the guidance of leaders and senior teachers, my ideological quality has been improved.
<br><br>

        The ability to work has improved;
Cultural literacy has been improved;
My practical ability has been enhanced...
There is no end to learning. I will work hard and try my best to be the best.
Although the fate in their own hands, but sometimes pay may not have a return, if I was not selected, will not be discouraged, I will go on to sum up the lessons learned, make up for the shortcomings.
<br><br>

        With a strong sense of responsibility, strong interest in learning, strong practical ability and quick acceptance ability, and the ability to complete various work tasks excellently, I have won the high school teachers' unanimous praise, which makes me more confident and become the source of knowledge in my future work and life.
The rich social work experience not only broadens my vision, but also forms my steady, decisive, enthusiastic and efficient work style.
In primary school, middle school, high school and university, I have been class monitor and commissator in charge of study. I have successfully organized numerous in-school and off-school activities for classes. My work has been recognized by my classmates and praised by my teachers.
I also interviewed my classmates and teachers, and I wanted to ask them their opinions on indulging in online games.The following is the record of my interview with the first classmate. I said, "hi, Conor, I would like to ask you about your opinions and opinions on students' addiction to video games." he said," of course, I think I still have a lot of opinions on students' addiction to video games."I said, "my first question is what do you think is the effect of students being addicted to video games?"He said, "in my opinion, as a student addicted to video games, of course, there will be many bad effects. First of all, as a student, I think study is the most important thing. Of course, keeping a healthy body is also important.However, addicted to video games can cause these two important things to be affected, why?Because if you are addicted to video games, your extracurricular time will be occupied by games, you don't have time to review your lessons, or even to write your homework, you know that will lead to the decline of your grades, affect your GPA, your GPA is very low, you are a student who doesn't work hard.And another thing, you also don't have time to exercise your body, and stay in your room, small range does not have a good sleep, I learned that some students like to play video games all night, this will cause you can't maintain a healthy body, the first is your eyes may be myopic, because has been on the electronic screen, your eyes can not get rest, there is too much for your body.I think that's what I think of as a bad influence.
